# Voron 2.4

These STL's are based on the offical release of the Voron 2.4 3d printer. Original files can be found in [Voron Github](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2).

CAD includes the original V2.4 CAD files. It also contains CAD of my remixes and partially of mods.

Files in this repo are partially remixed to fit my personal needs. 

**Files i do not use are not part of this repo. Only parts that can be found on my V2.4 can be found here.**

Some parts in this repo are partially remixed to fit my personal needs. 

Remixes are marked as such by (r)_ in front of the filename. Mods are in subdirectories. The file names are adapted to the Voron design in terms of color (accent or main). When it comes to mods for the complete replacement of components, they are linked at the appropriate place.

Some mods require the purchase of additional parts. A BOM for each mod is available. Links are provided (where possible) to the components I used, excluding nuts and bolts.

I will do my best to turn all remixes and mods to be printable as they are in the STLs. But check it yourself before you print. Since it's quite a lot and I created this repo afterwards, I might have gone through one or the other file.
